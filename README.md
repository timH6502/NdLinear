# NdLinear

ND-Linear Layer with Configurable Dimensional Processing Order.

Extends Algorithm 1 from "NdLinear Is All You Need for Representation Learning"
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17353) to support arbitrary dimension processing orders.

Original algorithm from
* Alex Reneau, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Zhongfang Zhuang, Ting-Chun Liu: “NdLinear Is All You Need for Representation Learning”, 2025; [http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17353 arXiv:2503.17353].
